**feat:** New `on*` properties which are similar to native `on*` properties such as `el.onclick`.

With builtin events, for example, when the builtin `click` event is dispatched,
the element's `el.onclick()` method is called automatically if it exists. Now we
can achieve the same behavior with custom events, so that for example
`el.dispatchEvent(new Event('myevent'))` will also cause `.onmyevent()`
to be called if it exists.

Example:

```js
// This element will dispatch "foo" events, and `.onfoo = () => {}` can be used
// for listening to them.
@element('my-el')
class MyEl extends Element {
	@event onfoo = null
}

// Optionally make a specific type of Event with unique state.
class FooEvent extends Event {
	constructor() {
		super('foo')
	}
}

const el = new MyEl()
document.body.append(el)

el.onfoo = () => console.log('foo!')

el.dispatchEvent(new FooEvent()) // logs "foo!"
el.dispatchEvent(new Event('foo')) // logs "foo!"
```

**feat:** improve the JSX type helpers:

- `on*` event properties can now be specified to define event props for JSX. The
  README has an example, plus the `jsx-types-*.test.tsx` files show all the type
  test cases.
  - They will be mapped without string values, accepting only functions.
- For Solid specifically, all the `on*` properties are also mapped to `on:*` JSX
  props with the same types.
- Any boolean JSX props will also accept "true" and "false" string values.
- Any number JSX props will also accept number strings, f.e. "1.23".
- For Solid specifically, automatically map prop types for `attr:`, `prop:`, and
  `bool:` prefixed JSX props.
  - `attr:` props will accept only strings.
    - `attr:` props mapped from boolean JS properties will specifically accept
      "true" and "false" strings.
    - `attr:` props mapped from number JS properties will specifically accept
      number strings, f.e. "1.23".
  - Only boolean JS properties will map to `bool:` JSX props, and f.e. `bool:`
    will not be available for any number props.
    - `bool:` props will accept only booleans, and not the "true" or "false"
      strings (otherwise Solid will set the attribute to always exist regardless
      of the value, and this is not an issue with React props because React props
      always map to JS properties never attributes when it comes to Lume
      Elements).
    - The `attr:` props will accept only "true" or "false" strings.
    - The non-prefixed JSX props, and `prop:` props, will accept both booleans
      and "true" or "false" strings.
  - Number JS properties are mapped to JSX props that accept numbers as well as
    number strings, but similar to boolean properties:
    - The `attr:` props accept only number strings.
    - And there are no `bool:` props mapped for number properties.
  - **POSSIBLY BREAKING:**: This update adds JSX types for `on*` event
    properties, which has a tiny chance of being breaking. If you had a typed JSX
    prop like `onerous` for an element whose JSX types you defined with
    `ElementAttributes`, there might be a type error because the type definition
    will expect a function that handles an `Event` (that is named
    `"erous"`), but this scenario is unlikely. To migrate, use the `prop:` prefix
    to set the JS property instead, for example `prop:onerous={notAnEventHandler}`.
