# pota

pota is a small, pluggable, yet fully-featured Reactive Web Renderer,
designed to work with `html` and `xml`.

pota is compiler-less, allowing you to use it with an `html` function.
It also includes a Babel preset for transforming `JSX` into fast and
compact partials inspired by
[dom-expressions](https://github.com/ryansolid/dom-expressions). You
may still use `transform-react-jsx` or `tsc`, as transformation needs
no magic.

#### Philosophy

The API and Core components, draw significant inspiration from
[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), albeit things differ to an extent
based on personal preferences. It can be said that this project is
what I wish solid to be.

pota prioritizes simplicity, consistency, usage, and is subjectively
easy to understand. It's driven by developer needs, and wont
compromise these for benchmarks. It is
[still fast](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html)
while respecting the core philosophy.
